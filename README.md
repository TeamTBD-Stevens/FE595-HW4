# FE595-HW4

This is a submission for homework assignment #4 for FE595; it is composed of two parts. The first part uses the Boston housing dataset to perform LinearRegression and determine the relative impact of each feature on the target variable. At the end of the script, a list of the correlation coefficients of each feature is printed. The second part uses the Iris dataset and creates an elbow heuristic to determine whether 3 is the optimal number of clusters for the dataset or not.
